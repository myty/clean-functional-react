# Clean React Hooks

React hooks were released in 2019.  Since then, we've been enamored with their simplicity and composability. Anyone that uses hooks extensively, quickly finds out that the components that consume them, get complicated and messy...real fast. Trying to do hooks in any large scale codebase becomes even more difficult, not to mention, testing is usually an after thought. My hope with this series is to bring some clarity and structure to our custom react hooks and the components that use them.  The end goal is that our hooks are clean, organized, understandable, and dare I say testable. ðŸ˜²
